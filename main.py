Main entry point for the Project KnowledgeBase application.

This module is responsible for parsing command‑line arguments and
dispatching to the appropriate sub‑commands.  It should coordinate
ingestion of projects, searching the knowledge base, and any other
top‑level operations.  For now it contains placeholder logic.
