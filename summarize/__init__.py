"""
Summarisation package for Project KnowledgeBase.

This package contains functions and classes for creating concise
descriptions of code or text.  Summarisation improves search by
capturing intent rather than relying solely on keywords.  You can
implement a simple heuristic summariser or integrate a language model
here.  The intent summariser is responsible for converting a chunk
into a one‑sentence description.
