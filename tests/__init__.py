"""
Unit tests for Project KnowledgeBase.

This package contains test modules that verify the correctness of
individual components.  Each module under `project_kb_scaffold` should
have a corresponding test file here.  Use a test framework such as
`pytest` or Python's built‑in `unittest` to write tests.
