"""
Embedding package for Project KnowledgeBase.

This package provides utilities for converting text into numeric
representations.  You might start with simple bag‑of‑words or TF‑IDF
embeddings and later integrate transformer models.  The embedder
should expose a single function that accepts a string and returns a
vector suitable for similarity search.
